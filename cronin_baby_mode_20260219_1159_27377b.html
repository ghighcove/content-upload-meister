<h1>Mick Cronin Is Stuck In Baby Mode</h1>
<h3>UCLA just lost back-to-back games by 30+. Their coach's response was to eject his own player. There's a word for this.</h3>

<hr />
<p>With 4:26 left in a 27-point blowout loss to Michigan State, UCLA guard Steven Jamerson II committed a flagrant foul on a Carson Cooper dunk attempt. It was a hard foul. It was called correctly. It was also not a flagrant 2, which means no automatic ejection.</p>
<p>What happened next was entirely optional.</p>
<p>Mick Cronin called Jamerson to the bench, grabbed him by the jersey, and walked him to the locker room. His own player. His own decision. In a game that was already over.</p>
<p>Then he went to the postgame press conference and snapped at a reporter for asking about Michigan State's student section chants. "I would like to give you a kudos for the worst question I've ever been asked," he said. "You really think I care about the other team's student section?"</p>
<hr />
<p>There's a term for this kind of behavior in competitive sports: <em>baby mode.</em></p>
<p>Baby mode isn't about the losses. Losses happen. Even programs with deep talent and smart coaching lose games — sometimes by a lot. Baby mode is what kicks in when a coach (or a player, or a team) stops absorbing the losses and starts externalizing them. Onto the refs. Onto the press. Onto a player who committed a hard foul on a play that didn't matter in a game that was over.</p>
<p>Baby mode is the tell. It's the gap between where a competitor thinks they should be and where they actually are — and instead of closing that gap through adjustment, they perform distress at the unfairness of it all.</p>
<hr />
<p>UCLA just lost consecutive games by 20-plus points for the first time since 1944-45. Michigan by 30. Michigan State by 23. That's not variance. That's a structural problem.</p>
<p>And here's what makes the Jamerson ejection strange beyond its surface absurdity: Jamerson is a transfer who played his first two seasons at Michigan State. He knows the arena. He knows the team. He committed a hard foul in a game where the outcome was settled and the only thing left was to play the remaining four minutes with some dignity.</p>
<p>Cronin ejecting him for that — grabbing his jersey, walking him off — reads less like discipline and more like a coach who couldn't contain his own frustration and needed somewhere to put it.</p>
<p>That's the baby mode tell. Not <em>what</em> you do, but <em>why</em> you do it in the moment you choose to do it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bubble picture isn't pretty. UCLA is running out of time to make a case for the tournament, and the path back doesn't run through blaming reporters for their questions or sending your own players to the locker room over fouls that didn't affect anything.</p>
<p>It runs through the stuff that's harder to perform: honest assessment, system adjustment, and keeping composure when the scoreboard is ugly.</p>
<p>Cronin is a veteran coach. He's won games, built programs, taken teams deep. This isn't a story about whether he's a good coach over the long arc. It's about what losing does to a competitor's judgment in the moment — and what those moments reveal.</p>
<p>Baby mode isn't permanent. But it is data.</p>
